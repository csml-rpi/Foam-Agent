I want to simulate a classic lid-driven cavity flow problem. This is a 2D square cavity with dimensions 1m × 1m × 0.01m (effectively 2D).
The cavity is filled with incompressible fluid. The top wall moves at 1 m/s in the x-direction, while the other three walls remain stationary.
Use a structured grid of 64×64×1 cells, with a time step of 0.005 seconds, simulating for 20 seconds total.
The fluid viscosity (`nu`) is 1e-03 m²/s, and gravity is not considered.
Output results every 200 time steps, and generate pressure and velocity contour plots.
