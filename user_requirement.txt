Do an incompressible lid driven cavity flow. 
The cavity is a square with dimensions normalized to 1 unit on both the x and y axes and very thin in the z-direction (0.1 unit scaled down by a factor of 0.1, making it effectively 2D). 
Use a grid of 20X20 in x and y direction and 1 cell in z-direction(due to the expected 2D flow characteristics). 
The top wall ('movingWall') moves in the x-direction with a uniform velocity of 1 m/s. 
The 'fixedWalls' have a no-slip boundary condition (velocity equal to zero at the wall). 
The front and back faces are designated as 'empty'. 
The simulation runs from time 0 to 10 with a time step of 0.005 units, and results are output every 100 time steps. 
The viscosity (`nu`) is set as constant with a value of 1e-05 m^2/s
