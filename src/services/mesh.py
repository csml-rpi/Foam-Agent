    "- How to control mesh sizing and refinement "

    "- Create complex geometries using GMSH Python API "
    "- Set up proper boundary conditions for OpenFOAM "
    "- Implement mesh refinement strategies "
    "- Generate 3D meshes with correct boundary assignments "
    "CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: "
    "- Always generate 3D meshes for OpenFOAM simulations "
    "- Set mesh sizes and generate 3D mesh: gmsh.model.mesh.generate(3) "
    "- AFTER 3D mesh generation, identify surfaces using gmsh.model.getEntities(2) "
    "- Use gmsh.model.getBoundingBox(dim, tag) to analyze surface positions and categorize them "

    "CRITICAL: Use bounding box coordinates consistently for ALL boundary types - do not mix center points and bounding box coordinates in the same boundary detection logic "
    "MOST CRITICAL FIX: If boundaries are missing after gmshToFoam, move ALL physical group creation to AFTER gmsh.model.mesh.generate(3) "

    "- Ensure thin surfaces at z_min and z_max are properly classified as boundary surfaces "
